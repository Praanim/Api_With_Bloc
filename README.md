# API INTEGRATION WITH STATE MANAGEMENT PROJECT (Bloc)

    In this project I have integratd (REQRES API) and managed states using BLOC.
    This app demonstrate all the fundamental API methods like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.

    Routing is also properly to make app more scalable.



## DESCRIPTION

    
    In this project i have added an additional feature i.e the app continously checks for the
    INTERNET CONNECTION throughout the app in all pages.For this i used CONNECTIVITY_PLUS package
    from pub.dev.To describe more, basically if at any point of time internet connection is gone 
    then it will give error state saying "There is no Internet Connection" also using
     CONNECTIVITY package app also tells the type of connection whether it is Mobile data connection or WIFI   connection.
